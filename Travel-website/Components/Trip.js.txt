          text="From the idyllic beaches of Bali to the chaotic melting pot of Jakarta, Indonesia is a diverse Southeast Asian gem.
          West Java and Sumatra are home to some of the most beautiful tropical forests in the world – perfect for jungle trekking.
           The Prambanan collection of Hindu temples in Yogyakarta will astound you with their architecture and aura of spirituality."

          a land where ancient rainforests give way to multicultural city life.
           Capital city Kuala Lumpur is visually defined by the iconic 
           Petronas Twin Towers, while in charming Melaka the vibe is more quaint and historical."

          text="Paris has a reputation for being the ultimate romantic getaway.
          But what visitors really swoon over is the city itself.
           Those grand stone and wrought-iron buildings, the sidewalks brimming with cozy cafés,
            and the Seine’s curving riverbanks are downright cinematic. 
            But the city’s charms go beyond looks. The culinary scene creates an endless list of must-eat French dishes—rich and hearty coq au vin,
            golden buttery croissants."
