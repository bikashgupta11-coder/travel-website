        text="Bora Bora Island is a dreamed sought-after destination for a romantic trip in French Polynesia. With its surprising landscape combining high mountains and atoll sceneries, Bora Bora is named 
      « the Pearl of the Pacific
       » thanks to its extreme beauty and paradise beaches. This islet setting will invite you to romance in the tranquility of its crystal clear lagoon.
        Be tempted by the original concept of the overwater bungalow for a stay closer to the lagoon. In this idyllic environment,
         you will forget it all! In one of the most beautiful lagoons in the world, you will make the most of a dive, an outrigger canoe or boat ride and be amazed by the incredible underwater scenery!
          Bora Bora won’t be just a trip but a marvelous experience."

         Its heady sights and sounds dazzle,
          frazzle and enchant, 
          as they have done for almost a millennia.
           Bustle takes on a whole new meaning,
            particularly in the Marrakesh medina.
        Whether you want to spice up your pantry with North African flavors or
         buy a carpet to add Moroccan-wow to your house,
          Marrakesh is one of the best shopping destinations in the world. Got your map ready?
           Well, it's probably of little use to you here.
            Think of the medina's souqs as a shopping mall, dotted with shops,
             accommodations, museums and historic sites, but laid out according to a labyrinthine medieval-era plan."
